# microbit_games

Little games for the BBC micro:bit. Inspired by Kari's video series
porting classic BASIC games to Python.

These can be used on [the micro:bit interactive Python editor][1] to
both run in a simulator and also send to your micro:bit. The .hex file
is also included which you can download directly to the micro:bit over
USB.

## Target.py

This is similar to the second game in [Converting 80s Computer Games
into Python][2]. A target pixel will show across the top and the
player will be positioned along the bottom. Use the A button to move the
player position to the right (wrapping around to the left) and use the
B button to fire!
